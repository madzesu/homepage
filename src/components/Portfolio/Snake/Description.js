                I wanted spice up things and challenge myself by creating a game which
                would rely on keyboard interaction, but I wasn't sure what to create.
                Luckily few days after getting the initial idea, I saw our chihuahua
                crawl like a worm while playing on the floor. I had the moment of
                lightbulb switching on. At the beginning of 2000s, I had this Nokia
                phone which had some catchy games on it. I used to play one of the games
                a lot, to an extent I was a force to be reckoned with. The title of the
                game was â€“ Snake. I wanted to relive the moments, but this time by coding
                the game.
